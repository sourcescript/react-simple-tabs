# react-simple-tabs
Tabs in React that doesn't get in your way.

## Usage

As a work-in-progress, we aim for this usage:

```jsx
<Tab>
  <TabList>
    <TabItem>Home</TabItem>
  </TabList>

  <TabBox>
    <TabContent>Whatever</TabContent>
  </TabBox>
</Tab>
```

This way, it doesn't try to assume which selector should be used to style the tabs, nor should it try to hide something away from its consumer.
